            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Whereby, all men may ſee how the <hi>Church,</hi> and poor Biſhop of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> do ſeem to ſtand in the hands of <hi>Scyron</hi> and <hi>Procruſtes:</hi> The Souldiers of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers,</hi> that fought againſt their King, and do ſtill detain the Church-land from the Biſhop; And now (like that in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> wounded in the houſe of our friends.) the Souldiers in 49. that were <hi>moſt faithful</hi> unto your Majeſty, do ſtill ſeek to take away <hi>our Houſes</hi> from the Church. And if we loſe both <hi>Houſe</hi> and <hi>Land,</hi> we may go to live in the <hi>Church,</hi> and lie with the <hi>Levite</hi> in the Streets.</p>
                  <p>But, as your Majeſty hath been <hi>moſt Gracious</hi> to the
<pb facs="tcp:45275:4"/> Biſhops, and to <hi>all</hi> the Clergy ſo <hi>bountifull,</hi> as to grant them <hi>almoſt</hi> as much as we could deſire; ſo our hope and <hi>humble Requeſt</hi> is, that you will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>theſe men</hi> to take from us, <hi>ſo much</hi> as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
                  <p>For the preventing of which deſire of theirs, if it may be; I have endeavoured to arm my ſelf with a <hi>reſolution,</hi> neither to <hi>fear</hi> nor <hi>flatter</hi> any man; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And becauſe the <hi>ears</hi> of all Church-robbers, are like the ears of the <hi>deaf Adder,</hi> that will not be charmed, and the <hi>walls</hi> of this ſin of <hi>Sacriledge</hi> are like the walls of <hi>Jericho,</hi> that cannot be <hi>tumbled</hi> down, without the ſhrill ſound of <hi>Trumpets</hi> and Rams horns; I have ſharpned my <hi>Pen,</hi> and, in the <hi>bitterneſs</hi> of my ſoul, for the <hi>havock</hi> that I ſee made of the <hi>Patrimony</hi> of God's Church, I have indeavoured to ſpeak, not in the <hi>mild</hi> voice of <hi>Eli to his ſons;</hi> but with the <hi>rough</hi> ſpeeches of <hi>Joſeph</hi> unto his <hi>brethren,</hi> that had ſlept ſo <hi>many years</hi> in their ſins, as our people have done in their <hi>Sacriledge;</hi> and yet think it to be no ſin.</p>
                  <p>And I doubt not, but that this <hi>my Diſcourſe</hi> will prove as the waters of gall, and as bitter as <hi>wormwood</hi> unto thoſe mens ſtomacks, that are ſo <hi>greedy,</hi> as we ſee men are, to get away the <hi>lands</hi> and poſſeſſions of the Church, and my ſelf to be <hi>maligned</hi> and envyed to the full; But I aſſure them, <hi>Non flocci facio,</hi> I weigh it not a ruſh; for I have hardened my face <hi>like an Adamant,</hi> and as the Lord ſaith to <hi>Ezechiel, Whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear,</hi> I will ſpeak what I conceive
<pb facs="tcp:45275:5"/> to be truth; and nothing but what my <hi>Conſcience</hi> tells me is truth. And if in <hi>any thing</hi> I ſhall miſtake, it is not <hi>amor erroris,</hi> the love of error, or the hatred of any of thoſe <hi>Sacrilegious</hi> perſons that rob the Church; but it is <hi>error amoris,</hi> the error of my love to the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> and unfaigned deſire, to promote the <hi>ſervice of God,</hi> and the good of the <hi>poor and honeſt Iriſh</hi> of this Kingdom; and ſo if I have <hi>offended,</hi> I ſhall <hi>humbly</hi> crave your Majeſties <hi>pardon,</hi> and moſt <hi>willingly</hi> ſubmit my ſelf to the cenſure of the <hi>Church;</hi> and with my <hi>morning, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> and <hi>noon-daies</hi> prayers for your Majeſtie's <hi>long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life,</hi> and much happineſs, I reſt.</p>

                     <p>Therefore, when either <hi>Biſhop</hi> or any other <hi>Clergy</hi> man, from the <hi>letter</hi> of the law, doth pervert the <hi>end</hi> and abuſe the meaning of the law; I make it a <hi>caſe</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi> and demand, Whether ſuch men, as do let out the <hi>lands</hi> and <hi>houſes</hi> of the Church for their own <hi>private</hi> gain, and not for the benefit of Gods <hi>Church</hi> and the advancement of Gods <hi>ſervice,</hi> do not commit this horrible ſin of <hi>Sacriledge?</hi> For my part, I conceive them to be the <hi>worſt</hi> and moſt <hi>Sacrilegious</hi> perſons of all others, that ſhould <hi>know</hi> the truth, and not give ſuch <hi>ill examples</hi> both of <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Sacriledge</hi> unto their neighbours: but let them leaſe what they will for the benefit of<note place="margin">How the Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops and other Clergy-men may leaſe their Lands without Sacriledge.</note> Gods Church, the <hi>furtherance</hi> of Religion, and the <hi>no-prejudice</hi> of their ſucceſſors, and they ſhall never find me to oppoſe them; But otherwiſe, to leaſe the <hi>lands</hi> of the Church, that is better worth then a 100 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> for leſs then a 100 s. for to make our <hi>children</hi> great and the <hi>Church</hi> poor, to benefit our <hi>ſelves</hi> and to prejudice Gods <hi>ſervice,</hi> and to ſay, We have a <hi>law,</hi> that warrants us to do it; We have <hi>Acts</hi> of Parliament that <hi>allow</hi> it, and have the practice and <hi>preſidents</hi> of <hi>other</hi> Biſhops, Deans, and Chapters, that have done it; is but to ſay, as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid to <hi>Pilate, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die.</hi> And ought he therefore to die, think you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, theſe <hi>Jews</hi> had ſuch a <hi>law?</hi> I verily think, <hi>not ſo;</hi> and I think like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that though you have, or ſhould have, a <hi>law</hi> to take away and <hi>alienate</hi> the rights of the Church; yet you ſhould <hi>not do it,</hi> if you love the Church, or do any waies <hi>fear</hi> God.</p>

By which courſe, ſhould it continue, ſcarce any of them could be able to live and keep houſe, according to their Place and Callings. We know the Statute makes it alike lawful for a Dean and Chapter to let their Leaſes for the Term of one and twenty years, or three Lives; but time and experience have made it apparent, that there is a great deal of difference between them, eſpecially in Church-Leaſes, where men are commonly in years before they come to thoſe Places.

                     <p>Let the Latines <hi>ſit ſtill</hi> and look on.

                     <p>But about this <hi>reſt</hi> that is here ſpoken of, the Expoſitors cannot all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, when it was: whileſt they do conſider the many <hi>Battels</hi> that he fought after this conference that he had with <hi>Nathan;</hi> and therefore, though ſome take it for the <hi>peace</hi> he had at this <hi>preſent</hi> time, yet others, of a quicker ſight, do aſſign it after the <hi>ſecond Victory</hi> he had againſt the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines,</hi> when he was ſuch an hammer, ſo terrible to all the <hi>neighbour</hi>-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as that the very name of <hi>David</hi> and his doings, made them afraid, and glad to ſue unto him for <hi>peace,</hi> and to take bands of reſolution with themſelves, to be of <hi>good behaviour</hi> towards him, and never to <hi>provoke</hi> him any more.

                     </argument>
                     <p>YOu have heard, how that God hath given the <hi>Power</hi> and Authority unto <hi>Kings</hi> and Princes, to be the <hi>Superviſors,</hi> Directors, and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of things amiſs, as well in the <hi>Church,</hi> as in the <hi>Common-wealth:</hi> And how he requireth and <hi>commandeth</hi> them, to diſcharge <hi>thoſe Duties</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; and to have a care to <hi>preſerve</hi> his Religion, as they do regard their own <hi>Salvation.</hi> You have likewiſe heard, how all Kings, both <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> did execute that <hi>power,</hi> and, according to their ability, diſcharged their <hi>Duties,</hi> as well in the <hi>Spiritual</hi> juriſdiction of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical</hi> cauſes, as in the deciſion of <hi>Civil</hi> cauſes. It reſteth, that I ſhould ſhew unto you, the <hi>chiefeſt Parts</hi> and Duties, that they <hi>owe</hi> to God, and are to <hi>diſcharge,</hi> for the promoting of his <hi>Service,</hi> and the Religion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And I conceive them <hi>principally</hi> to conſiſt in theſe Four <hi>Points,</hi> which may be like the four Rivers of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> to water the <hi>Garden</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The four chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things that Kings &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to do for the uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of God's Religion, and the Service of Jeſus Chriſt.</note> of God's Church, to make it to bring forth <hi>plenty</hi> of fruits, to the <hi>glory</hi> of God, and the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of mens ſouls. And they are,</p>
                     <p>1. To take care, and to <hi>cauſe,</hi> that there ſhould be <hi>Cathedral-Churches</hi> and Chappels <hi>fairly</hi> built, and <hi>decently</hi> trimmed and adorned, as befits the <hi>Houſes</hi> of God, for his people to meet in, for the <hi>Worſhip</hi> and Service of God.</p>
                     <p>2. To ſee that <hi>alle,</hi> honeſt, and religious <hi>Biſhops</hi> be placed in thoſe <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrals,</hi> and others the like <hi>pious</hi> and painful <hi>Miniſters,</hi> be appointed in all the <hi>Parochial</hi> Churches and Chappels, to perform the <hi>true Service</hi> of God as they ought to do; and to ſee thoſe <hi>Drones</hi> that neglect it, and thoſe <hi>factious</hi> Sectaries and Hereticks that defile and corrupt it, and thoſe <hi>ſcandalous</hi> livers, that do much prejudice unto their holy Calling, to be <hi>puniſhed,</hi> and removed, if they <hi>amend not,</hi> for their negligence and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.</p>
                     <p>3. To provide, by their <hi>good Laws</hi> ſuch maintenance, <hi>revenues,</hi> and means for the Reverend, and <hi>godly</hi> Biſhops, and the reſt of the <hi>worthy</hi> Clergy, whereby they may be <hi>inabled</hi> with joy and comfort, to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge</hi> their duties in God's Service, to his <hi>glory,</hi> and the good of his people.</p>
                     <p>4. To put a <hi>bar,</hi> and to hinder by their <hi>Regal</hi> power and authority all the <hi>ſacrilegious</hi> violaters of <hi>holy</hi> things to <hi>rob</hi> the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his ſervants, and to commit the horrible ſin of <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> which is ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently <hi>abominable</hi> in the ſight of God, and ſo <hi>infinitely</hi> deſtructive to the ſouls of men.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Anſwer to the choiceſt, and chiefeſt Objection that the Schoole of Anabaptiſts have made, and do urge againſt the payment of Tythes now, in the time of the Goſpel.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt, though the <hi>truth</hi> of this point, that all <hi>Tythes,</hi> as well in the time of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as under the <hi>Law,</hi> and before the law, are <hi>continually</hi> due to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> our <hi>eternal Prieſt;</hi> and ſo at all times <hi>payable,</hi> and to be given to his <hi>Subſtitutes</hi> and under-Prieſts, is as <hi>clear</hi> as the <hi>Sun:</hi> yet, ſuch hath been and is the <hi>malice</hi> of Satan againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Church,</hi> that he hath raiſed up, and <hi>ſtirred</hi> a whole <hi>Army</hi> of Sectaries, Anabaptiſts, and Worldlings, that with might and main do <hi>fight</hi> againſt this <hi>Truth,</hi> and labour with all their <hi>wits,</hi> to ſuppreſs the ſame, and to drive it quite out of the <hi>World:</hi> And to that end, they do Object.</p>
                     <p>1. If all <hi>Tythes</hi> be thus due, as you ſay, by the <hi>Law of God,</hi> then they <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>1</label> are every <hi>where</hi> due, and all they do <hi>ſin,</hi> and grievouſly <hi>offend</hi> that do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them.</p>
                     <p>But many <hi>Countreys,</hi> and ſome Chriſtian <hi>Common-wealthes,</hi> no doubt, pay no <hi>Tythes</hi> at all, and are not acquainted with this <hi>faſhion</hi> of paying <hi>Tythes,</hi> and yet do ſufficiently and <hi>honorably</hi> maintain their <hi>Miniſters</hi> for the ſervice of God.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, queſtionleſs, the payment of <hi>Tythes</hi> is not due by the Divine Law.</p>
                     <p>To this Objection, I conceive Dr. <hi>Gardiner</hi> doth <hi>reaſonably</hi> well anſwer, <label type="milestone">

                     <p>That many things are of <hi>ſuch Nature,</hi> (though I think <hi>Tythes</hi> are not<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45275:55"/> places,</hi> as it may be in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches in <hi>France,</hi> have their <hi>immunities</hi> by themſelves, and are not <hi>charged</hi> with the payment of <hi>Tythes,</hi> (their ſtate and <hi>condition</hi> not admitting it) yet in <hi>lien</hi> of their <hi>Tythes,</hi> their Miniſters are <hi>maintained</hi> with as ſufficient ſupplies: and <hi>neceſſity</hi> excuſeth even in greater <hi>matters,</hi> as in not praying, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacraments, as well as in not paying <hi>Tythes,</hi> when the <hi>caſe</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>otherwiſe.</hi> As S. <hi>Paul,</hi> for ſome <hi>ſpecial</hi> exigency, took <hi>no ſtipend</hi> of <hi>ſome Churches</hi> for his labours, in the preaching of the Goſpel; Yet, he tells them, that by <hi>right</hi> he might have <hi>claimed</hi> it; and therefore inferreth, that what he did for ſome <hi>ſpecial cauſes,</hi> ſhould not be drawn into an <hi>example,</hi> to prejudice and <hi>defraud</hi> others of that which was their due.</p>
                     <p>So we ſay, That in <hi>thoſe Churches,</hi> which pay not their <hi>Tythes</hi> in kind, there is an <hi>allowance,</hi> equivalent to the <hi>Tythes,</hi> given to thoſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> that<note place="margin">The Miniſters of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches in the other Countrys have no cauſe to complain.</note> have no <hi>Tythes.</hi> And as the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> impoſed no <hi>Tribute</hi> upon thoſe ſubjects, that brought in their <hi>voluntary contributions,</hi> that increaſed their Exchequer <hi>more</hi> than their Tribute; So their <hi>Preachers</hi> have no cauſe to <hi>complain,</hi> for not receiving their <hi>Tythes,</hi> when they have <hi>as much,</hi> or more, than their <hi>Tythes</hi> are worth: And the example of <hi>theſe,</hi> that live by their ſet and <hi>certain ſtipend,</hi> ought not to be <hi>alleadged</hi> and pleaded, to the hurt and <hi>prejudice</hi> of them, that are ſuſtained by their <hi>Tythes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And though <hi>all this</hi> that I have ſaid be <hi>very true;</hi> yet, becauſe, as I conceive, it taketh not away the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the foreſaid Argument, which is, That if it be a <hi>Moral Precept,</hi> that doth <hi>oblige</hi> us to obſerve it, <hi>ſemper &amp; ad ſemper,</hi> then it obligeth <hi>all men,</hi> and in <hi>all places,</hi> to pay their <hi>Tythes,</hi> and they <hi>ſin,</hi> that pay them not, though they do pay ſome <hi>other ſtipend,</hi> be it more or leſs in lieu of them; becauſe it lieth not in man to <hi>alter</hi> or <hi>change</hi> the Commandment of God, but to do what he commandeth them; Therefore,</p>
                     <p>2. I ſay, and yield, That the <hi>Precept</hi> of paying <hi>Tythes</hi> for the Service of<note place="margin">2.

And ſo I have proved, It was their <hi>duty</hi> to pay <hi>Tythes,</hi> though they paid them not.</p>
                     <p>2. I ſay, that before the Law was given, the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the firſt age, <label type="milestone">

                     <p>And if they do Object and ſay, that if the <hi>precept</hi> of paying <hi>Tythes</hi> be of a <hi>Natural</hi> right, and a <hi>Moral</hi> precept, then the payment thereof is, or ought to be, commanded, within one of the ten Commandments of the

                        <p>Sheweth the objection of the Rebels to juſtifie their Rebellion: the firſt part of it anſwered, that neither our compulſion to Idolatry, nor any other injury or tyranny ſhould move us to Rebell.</p>

                     <p>BUt we muſt not <hi>condemn</hi> them before their cauſe be heard; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Corah</hi> ſhall have his Counſell, to object what he can for himſelf: And I find but one Objection of any moment, though the ſame conſiſteth of many branches.

                     </p>
                     <p>But to proceed to break this <hi>Gordian</hi> knot in pieces, and to anſwer each part of this Objection:</p>
                     <p>1. I ſay, that many <hi>wicked</hi> Kings, and <hi>cruel</hi> Emperours have ſet up<note place="margin">1. Part of their objection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Not to rebell for any cauſe 1. Not for our compulſion to Idolatry.</note> 
                        <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and blaſphemy againſt God, and yet I do not find that any of Gods ſervants did ever <hi>rebell</hi> againſt them; for you know <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nebat</hi> that made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin, did ſet up golden Calves to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon</hi> made an Image of gold, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all his people to fall down to worſhip it. And what ſhall I ſay of thoſe <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Kings, <hi>Achab, Manaſſes, Julian,</hi> and abundance more, that moſt impiouſly compelled their ſubjects unto <hi>Idolatry?</hi> and yet you ſhall not find that either the faithfull <hi>Jews</hi> under <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Elias</hi> the man of God in the time of <hi>Achab,</hi> or any of all the good <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that were under <hi>Julian,</hi> either did <hi>themſelves,</hi> or perſwaded <hi>others</hi> of the ſervants of God, at any time, to <hi>rebell</hi> againſt thoſe <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Kings: for they conſidered how far the Law of God that prohibiteth <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and inſtigateth us againſt the allurers and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of us to <hi>Idolatry</hi> and blaſphemy, extendeth; and that is, <hi>If thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>

                     <p>And the reaſon why they did all this, and proceeded thus farre againſt<note place="margin">The reaſon of their rebellion</note> 
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> is intimated in the words of my Text, <hi>Aemulati ſunt,</hi> becauſe they would <hi>emulate</hi> or <hi>imitate Moſes,</hi> that is, to play the <hi>Moſes,</hi> or play the <hi>King,</hi> and play the part of the <hi>chief</hi> Prieſt themſelves; for this is certain, that none will <hi>envy,</hi> murmure at, ſlander, and diſobey his King ſo farre, as to make an <hi>open</hi> rebellion againſt him, but they that in <hi>ſome</hi> ſort would rule and be Kings themſelves; eſpecially when they ſhall ſeek, ſo farre to <hi>debilitate</hi> their Prince, as that he ſhall be <hi>no</hi> wayes able to make reſiſtance; for they think, <hi>If Treaſon proſper, 'tis no Treaſon: what's the reaſon? if it proſper, who dares call it Treaſon?</hi> and none would diſobey their Biſhops or chief Prieſts, but they that would, and cannot be Biſhops themſelves; becauſe <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>ambition</hi> are the two ſides of that bellowes, which blowes up diſobedience and rebellion.</p>
                     <p>But they that are bad <hi>ſervants,</hi> will prove worſe <hi>Maſters;</hi> they that will not learn how to <hi>obey</hi> can never tell how to <hi>rule;</hi> and if <hi>Moſes</hi> were, as theſe <hi>Rebels</hi> ſuggeſted, a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> yet the Philoſopher tells us, we had better endure <hi>one</hi> Tyrant, then, as they were, 250.

And it <hi>ſeemed</hi> to ſome of his friends, that ſo he was; eſpecially becauſe they had no plain <hi>unqueſtionable</hi> Law, but were fain, in ſome kind, to <hi>make</hi> a Law, to take off his head; and when his head was off, this <hi>new</hi> manner of proceeding ſhould end, and be no Law for any other that came after: And a <hi>Declaration</hi> muſt be made, That the <hi>courſe</hi> proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his puniſhment, ſhall not afterward, be drawn into an <hi>Example;</hi> it muſt be produced for no <hi>Pattern,</hi> but for him <hi>alone</hi> and none other; leſt perhaps, if the ſame courſe ſhould be ſtill practiſed, the <hi>contrivers</hi> of this Plot, might have the <hi>like</hi> payment to fall ere long upon their own<note place="margin">Complaint to the Houſe of Commons. p. 6.</note> heads.

                     </argument>
                     <p>ANd thus the <hi>Sectaries</hi> of this Kingdom, and the Faction in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, have by their craft and ſubtilty prevailed to have all the <hi>chiefeſt</hi> impediments of their Deſign to be removed: So now the <hi>hedge</hi> is broken down, and all the <hi>Boars</hi> of the Forreſt may <hi>now</hi> come into the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, to deſtroy the <hi>vine,</hi> and to undermine the <hi>City</hi> of God: But, <hi>into their counſels let not my ſoul come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. When they had taken away theſe <hi>ſtops</hi> and hinderances of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, they were to recollect and make up the <hi>furtherances,</hi> that might help<note place="margin">2. The furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of their Deſign were five.</note> to advance their Cauſe, for the <hi>founding</hi> of their <hi>new</hi> Church, and the <hi>eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing</hi> of their famous <hi>Democratical</hi> Government, and popular Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. And theſe I find to be principally five.</p>
                     <p>1. The gaining of their Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to become their faſt and faithful friends.</p>
                     <p>2. The framing of a <hi>Proteſtation</hi> to frighten the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and to inſnare the <hi>ſimple,</hi> to be led as they liſted to proſecute their Deſign.</p>
                     <p>3. The condemning of our <hi>late Canons,</hi> as abominable in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with their Religion.</p>
                     <p>4. The appointing of a <hi>new Synod,</hi> the like whereof was never heard in the Church, ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> to compoſe ſuch <hi>Articles</hi> as they liked, and to frame ſuch <hi>Diſcipline</hi> as ſhould be moſt agreeable to their own diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>5. The ſetling of a <hi>Militia,</hi> a word that the vulgar knew not what it was, for to <hi>ſecure</hi> the Kingdom, as they pretended, from thoſe dangers that they feared, that is, from thoſe <hi>Jacks</hi> of Lent, and men of <hi>Clouts,</hi> which themſelves ſet up as <hi>deadly</hi> enemies unto the Church and State; but indeed <hi>inſenſibly</hi> to get all the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the Realm into their own hands, and their Confederates; that ſo they might, like the <hi>Ephori,</hi> bridle the King, and bring him as they pleaſed, to <hi>aboliſh,</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſh,</hi> what Laws and Government they ſhould propoſe; whereby, perhaps, he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue King in <hi>Name,</hi> but they in <hi>Deed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe were the things they <hi>aimed</hi> at, and they effected the firſt three, before they could be <hi>diſcryed,</hi> and their Plots diſcovered; but in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two, they were prevented, when God ſaid unto them, as he doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou go, and no further, here ſhalt thou ſtay thy proud waves:</hi> And therefore, I am confident (and I wiſh all good Chriſtians were ſo) that their purpoſes ſhall never ſucceed, nor themſelves <hi>proſper</hi> therein, while the World laſteth; becauſe God hath ſo mercifully <hi>revealed</hi> ſo much, ſo graciouſly <hi>aſſiſted</hi> our King, and ſo miraculouſly, not only <hi>delivered</hi> him from them, but alſo <hi>ſtrengthened</hi> him againſt them, contrary to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing likely-hood, to this very day; which is a <hi>ſufficient</hi> argument to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our faith, that we ſhall by the help of our God, eſcape all the <hi>reſt</hi> of their deſtructive Deſigns.</p>
                     <p>But to diſplay their <hi>Banners,</hi> to diſcover their <hi>Projects,</hi> and to let the <hi>World</hi> ſee what they are, and how <hi>cloſely</hi> and yet <hi>cunningly,</hi> they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to effect their work; I will in a <hi>plain</hi> manner ſet down what I know, and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:45275:114"/> what I have collected from other Writings, and from men that are <hi>fide dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> (for one mans eyes cannot ſee all things, nor <hi>infallibly</hi> perceive the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of all particulars) for to <hi>confirm</hi> the faithful Subjects in their due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, both to God, and their King, and to <hi>undeceive</hi> the poor ſeduced people, that they periſh not in the contradiction of <hi>Corah.</hi>

                  <p>But you may ſee it every day, that as the Poet ſaith,<note place="margin">Rich <hi>Creſus</hi> may ſuddenly become as poor as <hi>Irus.</hi>

And when both <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Cicily</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> and all <hi>Macedon</hi> have felt the ſtroke of your Majeſties Sword, what will you do then I pray you? ſaid the Orator; then the King perceiving what he meant, ſmilingly anſwered, we will then take our eaſe, and begin to make Feaſts, and continue ſo every day, and be as merry together as poſſibly we can be. And what letteth us now, my good Lord, ſaid <hi>Cyneas,</hi> but that we may be now as merry and more quiet, ſith we enjoy enough to effect all that preſently, without any further travel, or more trouble, which we are about to go to ſeek with ſuch ſhedding of humane blood of others, with ſo much manifeſt danger unto our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding all this, the Learned Orator could not diſſwade that am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Prince from this his high attempt, he could no waies prevail to make him deſiſt from that uncertain Enterprize; but he would rather hazard all that happy eſtate which he did now enjoy, than leave off the deceitful hope of thoſe things which he did ſo much deſire.</p>
                  <p>And indeed ſuch is the condition of all the ſons of men, moſt dangerouſly ſick of the ſame deſperate diſeaſe; for though as the Poet ſaith, and he ſaith the truth, that man is but,

                     </q> That is in few words, a dream, a ſhadow, a thought, a nothing; yet all or moſt of this little time that we do enjoy, we expand in following after the vain wealth, and deceitful riches of this world, that we ſhall find to be but empty clouds, without water, or like the Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> that being greedily graſped, will ſoon turn to ſmoak, and then ſpeedily vaniſh into nothing; and we ſhall find our ſelves at laſt juſt like the Mill-wheel, that turneth ſtill, and turneth round from day to day, and yet at the years end is in the ſame place where it was at the beginning.</p>
                  <p>So we tumble and toſſe and turn to gather wealth, and to grow great in this world, and yet in the end we ſhall find our ſelves juſt in the ſame condition as we were at the beginning; for <hi>naked we came into the world, and naked we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again.</hi>

                  <p>What need we then be ſo unjuſt, and ſhame our ſelves, either unduly to ſeek what we ought not to have, or unhoneſtly to deny what we ought to pay? Truly I am aſhamed, that ſhould be verified among Chriſtians, which was complained of by the heathens, <hi>Terras Aſtraea reliquit;</hi> that Juſtice could not be found in any Court on earth; or what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be found amongſt us, <hi>I ſaw the place of Judgment</hi> (the higheſt Court he meant) <hi>and wickedneſs was there, and the place of Righteouſneſs, and iniquity was there.</hi>

But</p>
                  <p>3. The vanity of our <hi>Diſſolution</hi> is the laſt and the worſt of all vanities. And this is,</p>
                  <p>1. When they ſee that they themſelves are Beaſts (theſe are the very words of the Scriptures) <hi>For that which befalleth the ſons of men, befalleth beaſts, even one</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>2. When they finde that they themſelves are worſe than beaſts, when the ſpirit of the beaſt that goeth downward to the earth, vaniſheth, and is reduced to nothing; but the ſpirit of the man that ſhould go upward, and be united to Eternity, ſhall deſcend to be chained in everlaſting miſery; <hi>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45275:221"/> greateſt of all vanities, becauſe the bond of our union with God is here diſſolved, and we are divorced from all the happy Eternity.</p>
                  <p>And thus I hope you ſee that man, be he never ſo excellent in condition, ſo eminent in place, or ſo powerfull in authority, yet here is no exception, no ex emption, no limitation, but he is altogether vanity.</p>
                  <p>And, though the time will not give me leave to amplifie all the particulars that might be ſhewed you out of this Text; yet I deſire your patience to give me leave to apply all briefly unto our ſelves, and to learn from hence this fivefold Leſſon, which may ſerve as a fivefold ſhield to preſerve us from all iniquity here, and from all miſery hereafter.</p>
                  <p>1. To eradicate and root up that ſtinking weed of pride and haughtineſs that <hi>Lucifer</hi> laboureth to ſpread ſo far, and to ſtick ſo faſt in the heart of every man; for why ſhouldſt thou be proud, thou vain thing, that art but duſt and aſhes, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vanity? what haſt thou to be proud of? the Lion may boaſt of his ſtrength, the Bezar of his precious ſtone, the Panther of his colours, and all other creatures of ſome ſingular excellency that is in them; but what haſt thou, that ſtandeſt there with a ſtiffe neck and proud looks, but what thou haſt received, and art juſt like the Jay decked about with borrowed ornaments, and haſt nothing of thine own to animate thy pride but what thou robbeſt from the bruit beaſts? and yet the fair Lady is proud of her <hi>white hands</hi> and pleated <hi>hair, &amp; lumina quae poſſunt ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare Deos;</hi> but alas two or three fits of an Ague will <hi>ſpoyl</hi> all, or elſe <hi>Age</hi> will make fair <hi>Helen</hi> to become as wrinkled as <hi>Hecuba.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay more than this, I have ſeen <hi>too much pride</hi> and arrogancy in ſome, that of all others ſhould be <hi>moſt humble,</hi> and teach others <hi>to be meek and lowly,</hi> which is a <hi>great ſhame,</hi> that thou, <hi>which teacheſt another, teacheſt not thy ſelf,</hi> and conſidereſt not what a <hi>vain thing</hi> thou art, and what <hi>little reaſon</hi> thou haſt to look <hi>ſo big,</hi> and to lift up thy head ſo <hi>high.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, the Saint-like <hi>Separatiſt,</hi> like the <hi>boaſting Phariſee,</hi> will be proud of his <hi>holineſs;</hi> but as St. <hi>Aug.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quod juſtitia adificaverat Phariſaeus, ſuperbia</hi>

                  <p>2. The conſideration of our <hi>vanity</hi> ſhould ever put us in minde of what the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Put not your truſt in Princes, nor in any childe of man;</hi> relye not on them, for there is <hi>no help in them,</hi> and the <hi>beſt</hi> of them, and <hi>greateſt,</hi> is not able to do the good he would do, becauſe he is <hi>altogether vanity,</hi> and when his breath goeth forth, <hi>he ſhall turn again to his earth, and then all his thoughts periſh;</hi> and as<note place="margin">Pſal. 146. 3, 4.</note>

                  <p>3. This may encourage us not to fear <hi>what man can do againſt us;</hi> let men <hi>threaten</hi> and fret and ſtorm as much as they <hi>will,</hi> and do as much as they <hi>can,</hi> yet fearing God, we need not fear any of them, becauſe the <hi>greateſt</hi> and moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man is but <hi>vanity,</hi> and <hi>altogether vanity;</hi> and if God be <hi>with us,</hi> who can be againſt us? <hi>Quia non plus valet ad dejiciendum terrena poena, quam ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
